## Favourite Blog Posts

## Programming

- Rust - Why Rust?

  Rust is a very niche spot where the only alternatives previously was C/C++
  from the mainstream langugages. But Rust has the ability to address those
  same requirements as well as go beyond them and target safety critical market
  as well. However, I expect that to take a lot longer because you need to have
  similar technologies like Ada Spark developed for Rust. However, it looks
  like Rust is going to have a pretty interesting future.

- Clojure - Why Clojure?

  In a word, it would be REPL driven development. The produtivity boost and
  immediateness of a repl has to be truly experienced to be appreciated in the
  long run.

- Go - Why Go?  Ease of development, and being productive. The standard library
  is one of the best out of the box.
- Haskell - Why Haskell?
