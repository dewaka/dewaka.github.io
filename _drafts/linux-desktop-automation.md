# Background

I have been using Linux as a primary platform for about 8 years now, and macOS
for about 5 years.

One thing I really miss from the broader Linux desktop is the automation
ability of the GUI tools. The equivalent of AppleScript is solely missing from
the Linux desktop applications. There is no such standard to publish.

AppleScript enables a couple of Hammerspoon like tools.

What is the Linux equivalent for macOS AppleScript?

What can we use something like Hammerspoon?

Linux terminal application scripting is another thing.
