Beeminder has been a really useful tool for me to keep focus on habits without
derailment.

Some of the habits I have been quite successful at,
- Reading
- Running

I have been tracking my runs in Strava for a couple of years now, but adding a
Beeminder goal had given me a commitment pledge to keep it up. It is always
encouraging to stay above the Yellow line!

## Challenges

Just creating a Beeminder commitment pledge is not going to make a habit stick.
This is something I learned from experience as well! In fact, I almost gave up
on Beeminder after by either archiving or deleting all my tracking goals.

What has been helpful for me is to find small facilitating habits to help the
larger goals. For example, now I am so much used to running in the morning that
I it is pretty difficult to motivate myself to run in the evening. On the other
hand, running in the morning has almost become as natural as having my morning
coffee now!

## Beeminder

Reading habit has helped me keep above the curve on my Goodreads reading
challenge. In fact, I managed to increase my reading target from a modest 35
goal to 60 and then eventually the current one at 80. I hope to keep achieve
this reading target this year.
