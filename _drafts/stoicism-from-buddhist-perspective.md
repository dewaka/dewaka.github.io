Introduction - why are these topics intersting?
Clarify and state where I am coming from.

Disclaimer - I'm not an expert in Buddhism, and I encourage you to go to primary
sources (or their translations) whenever possible, and my Stoic readings are
also from secondary sources.

Bit of history of Stoicism - 3rd century by Zeno https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism.

# What it means to be a Stoic?

Stoicism is a philosophy first. Not a theology.

# What it means to be a Buddhist?

Is Buddhism just a philosophy? Can you decouple Buddhism? Go on with a secular
Buddhism?

## What can Buddhism give you what Stoicism cannot?

What do I think about spirituality? Is spirituality still relevant? Buddhism and
spirituality?

# Where do they overlap?

Both have a realistic view of world. That world is suffering. Suffering is
everywhere and something you cannot forget about it.

What are their solutions?
- The Buddhist solution is personal development via the Eightfold path.
- Stoic philosophy involves contemplation about the mortality of human
  existence.
- Even when you are having a good run, it encourages you to imagines scenarios
  where one day you might lose all of that.
- What does Buddhism tell you at the core of the message - that there is nothing
  worth clinging onto. All attachment, at the fundamental level, is suffering.
  Does that means is it a nihilistic philosophy? Finding meaning in current
  existence might not be that simple when you are feeling down and depressed,
  and what is the Buddhist answer to that?
- Is Buddhism a secular religion? Can a secular Buddhism make sense?
- There's such a similarity between Insight meditation and Stoic contemplation.
  The question is whether you can use Insight meditation without buying into the
  full dogma of Buddhism.

# Where do they differ?

One thing I have been thinking about is that Buddhism takes things to the
logical extreme in a couple of different areas, such as things are impermanent
and things are illusioary in nature.

Stoicism puts a lot of emphasis in character ethics. This is something very
easy to grasp, comparative to Buddhist precept that you should be doing "good
things", and good things are defined

There are a couple of things which makes it difficult to follow and understand
Buddhism; it has a vast cannon, its primary focus is on ending the suffering
through Nirvana and that's an abstract concept which is difficult to grasp for a
layperson and which is even harder to follow.

- Is Buddhism too bitter a pill to swallow?
- What advantages can come out from following Buddhism compared to Stoicism?
  Buddhism offers a more structured approach to personal development through
  meditation.

There are a lot of parallels between core Stoic teachings and the Theravada
Buddhist concept of 'Eight Worldly Conditions'. This actually maps to learned
_indifference_ of the Stoics almost one to one.
