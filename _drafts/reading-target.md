## Strategies

These strategies are not going to work universally, and I'm *not* a prolific
reader at all. I'm also learning to read as I go along, but some of the advice
below helped me to do much better compared to last year.

- Have a set time for reading
- Read different books at different phases

  A little bit of speed reading can go a long way to finish a book quickly. My
  reading speed varies with the type of book and I think that's a good
  strategy. For example, for most types of self help books, I generally get the
  idea of what the author is talking about in a given chapter from the the
  first couple of paragraphs. Later _filler_ paragraphs can be read quite
  quickly without losing much of important information, if at all.

  On the other end of the spectram, I tend to slow down and read slowly generes
  such as novels and poetry. I don't think there's much point in reading poetry
  in the same vein as a self help book, only to get it *done* as quickly as
  possible.
- Start many books
