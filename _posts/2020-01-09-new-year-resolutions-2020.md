I thought of putting a bit of pressure on myself by making a list of goals
public. Some of goals, such as the reading target, I've already managed to reach
last year, but some, like writing, I've found quite difficult to stick with in
the past. Those are the kind of goals which I want to do better this year!

## Reading

- Books
  - I'm tracking reading progress in [Goodreads Reading
    Challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/19355732). Number of
    books read is _not_ a good metric if one is interested to improve the
    quality of reading, but it's an easily trackable one.
- Papers
  - My goal is to read and take notes of a minimum of 5 papers a month. I will
    be publishing the rough notes in the wiki on
    [papers](https://wiki.dewaka.com/papers). These notes are are expected to be
    rough around the edges, since they are written to an audience of one,
    namely, myself. I'm interested in using the [Feynman technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/) for learning things
    this year and wiki notes are a good way to experiment for this end.

## Writing

- Blog posts 
  - I hope to write about an intersting paper as a blog post based on the wiki
    notes. Goal is to write at least one blog post per month.
- Wiki updates
  - I've found that Gitbook format is really useful for keeping technical notes.
    I hope to keep this practice mostly as a brain dump for later reference.

## Coding

Given that most of my coding will be in the work enrvironment, it is hard to
come up with concrete goals for personal projects which I have a realistic goal
of commiting and sticking with.

There are broadly a couple of areas I would like to focus on this year though.

- Systems programming
  - Deep dive into JVM performance landscape
    - There a couple of books I would like to go through this year, such as -
      [Java Concurrency in
      Practice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127932.Java_Concurrency_in_Practice),
      [Effective Java Programming Language
      Guide](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/105099.Effective_Java_Programming_Language_Guide)<sup>[1](#effective-java)</sup>.
      and [Java Performance: The Definitive Guide](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774645-java-performance).
    - Playing with GC algorithms and knobs to get a better understanding of
      their various tradeoffs
    - Practical JMH benchmarking 
  - Native coding with Rust and C++ 
    - With C++ the goal is mostly to keep the knowledge up to date
    - With Rust there's so much to explore with many exciting possibilities!
- Functional programming - I'm going to use _functional_ programming in the most
  broad sense here,
  - Scala - there are many interesting libraries I'm looking forward to play
    with and also to play with. Scala 3 (Dotty) new language features look quite
    exciting as well.
  - Keeping up with Haskell research papers. 
  - Software verification - this is very broad topic which I have a strong
    interest in. On this front it would be aspirational for me to finish with
    practical coding [Practical TLA+: Planning Driven
    Development](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42389860-practical-tla).
  
## Activities

- Running
  - Keep up to the same level or do better than last year would be my goal this
    year for running!
- Hiking
  - Last year was a very productive and fun hiking year for me. I'm running
    out of _intermediate_ to _advanced_ one day hikes from groups like
    [Outdooraholics](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/) which I haven't
    done before! However, I still hope to do at least 5 one day hikes this year.
