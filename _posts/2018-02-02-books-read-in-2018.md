These are the books I have read thus far in 2018.

- [A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3047.A_Conflict_of_Visions) by Thomas Sowell.

  This is a great book to read in times like ours where political climate so
  polarised and driven by partisan frenzy. This books sheds light on different
  modes of thinking between traditional Liberal vs. Conservative political
  ideas.

- [Artemis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34928122-artemis) by Andy Weir.

  I got started reading this book because of the more famous book - The Martian,
  even though I haven't read it yet. Artemis, however, wasn't that interesting
  read even though I kind of liked the plot. I couldn't simply ignore the
  incongruities of the heroine's character.

- [Kybalion: A Study of the Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1363427.Kybalion).

  This book was my first dipping into Hermetic philosophy and mysticism. There
  are lot of things I would like to read about in Western mystical traditions,
  and this book was a good starting point.

- [Origin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32283133-origin) by Dan Brown.

  The only reason I _had_ to read the book was that I have read the other books
  from Robert Langdon series by Dan Brown. I didn't have great expectations that
  this book was going to be great, and thus, I wasn't disappointed to find it
  formulaic and predictable.

  On the other hand, I quite liked the real implications of a (near?) future
  where AIs might play a very significant role in everyday life with more and
  more autonomy. This book was stimulating in that aspect.

- [The Quest for Cosmic Justice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86312.The_Quest_for_Cosmic_Justice) by Thomas Sowell.

  This was my first introduction to Thomas Sowell's writings, and I immediately
  got interested to read more of his writings. In this book, Sowell tries to
  discuss about a very important subject, cosmic justice, in a dispassionate
  manner. I think that kind of matter of fact analysis is always good to have,
  especially on a subject as contentious as Cosmic justice, or its recent
  formulations in the form of Social justice.

- [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck) by Mark Manson.

  This was a quick fun read.

- [Call Me by Your Name](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98687.Call_Me_by_Your_Name) by Andr√©
  Aciman.

  This was a truly engrossing read. I read the book before watching the movie,
  and this book got me even more interested to watch the film.

- [Prometheus Rising](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28597.Prometheus_Rising) by Robert Anton Wilson.

  This is my first introduction to Robert Anton Wilson and it was a fun read. He
  tries to synthesise a different strands of thoughts into a cohesive framework
  with explanations borrowed from both Western and Eastern traditions from
  Quantum mechanics to Pranayama Yoga. This was a thought provoking read, and
  I'm interested to read more books from him.

- [Intellectuals and
  Race](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16280863-intellectuals-and-race) by
  Thomas Sowell.

  This is a book talking about a complex topic in an objective manner as much as
  possible without being dogmatic about its own conclusions. Similar to The
  Quest for Cosmic Justice by Sowell, this book also discusses how to bring
  change and improvements classes of people who were historically marginalised.

- [The Dhammapada](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8763142-the-dhammapada) translated by Eknath Easwaran

  I have read a couple of Dhammapada translations, and I started reading this
  translation based on good reviews for translations by Eknath Easwaran on
  ancient Indian texts.

  This translation does not contain original Pali verse on which the translation
  is based on, so if someone is looking to learn original verses this is not the
  book. There are really good open resources to learn about Dhammapada with
  original verses.

  To get the most out of the Dhammapada, at least this translation, one should
  be a bit familiar with (Theravada) Buddhism. For example, do not expect this
  book to explain what the [Eightfold Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path)
  is, but concepts like this are mentioned in the translated verses. However
  only a handful of integral Buddhist concepts are referenced in this book, thus
  even someone who is not familiar at all with Buddhism should be able to get
  something out of this book. Most of the messages in the book can be
  interpreted even in a non-religious way - say, good aphorisms to live life by.

- [12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30257963-12-rules-for-life) by Jordan B. Peterson

  This is not the first Jordan Peterson book I started reading; that would be
  his earlier work Maps of Meaning. However, I postponed reading Maps of Meaning
  book since I wanted to get a better context for the material he is discussing
  in the book by reading the works of Carl Jung etc. as a prelude for the book.
  
  12 Rules for Life is supposed to be a very different beast from his earlier
  work, targeting general public contrasting the general academic bent of his
  earlier work.
  
  I have come across and followed Peterson's positions through his prolific
  Youtube interviews and sometimes his lectures, which are also available
  through Youtube. So, the topics and "stories" the book talks about weren't
  completely alien to me.
  
  I think his message resonates with many people because he talks about taking
  personal responsibility and making your own mark standing to stand out from
  the crowd, without blindly following with herd mentality be it positions from
  left or right of the broader political divide. Yes, sometimes his positions
  can come out as "controversial", but if one takes time to evaluate them
  carefully one can see the reasoning he bases his positions on.
  
  His Jungian interpretations of Biblical stories was a fascinating read, but I
  kept wondering whether this is the _only_ way to evaluate those stories. I
  kept wondering how the book would have looked had he espoused a different
  religious tradition, say Buddhism for example.
  
  At times the book read almost as a one from the Stoic philosophical tradition;
  he does not try to sugarcoat life's suffering, and as a realist (and a
  Buddhist!) I appreciated the honesty. Yet, I do not think the central message
  of the book is pessimistic at all. On the contrary it is life affirming, and
  fundamentally about finding meaning in a chaotic world.
  
  This book is not a short bullet point list of things you should be doing to
  _confront chaos_ in life. Peterson has carried his conversationalist style
  which works well in a lecture format into the book as well. Thus, do not
  expect the chapters getting to the _point_ in a succinct manner. Although I
  quite enjoyed most of the stories he had to tell and I think that is one of
  the alluring aspects of the book, sometimes I just wanted to advance to the
  next _rule_ a hurry.
  
  All in all the book was a great read, and I hope it was also a good
  introduction to the general themes for Maps of Meaning which I intend to
  finish.
