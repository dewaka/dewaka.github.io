These are the books I have read thus far.

- [A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3047.A_Conflict_of_Visions) by Thomas Sowell.

  This is a great book to read in recent times like ours where polemical views
  are so much more polarised. This books sheds light on different modes of
  thinking between traditional Liberal vs. Conservative political ideas.

- [Artemis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34928122-artemis) by Andy Weir.

  I got started reading this book because of The Martian fame, even though I
  haven't read that book yet. However, this book was not that interesting and I
  have to agree with reviews in Goodreads that the lead character is completely
  out of character from what would expect.

- [Kybalion: A Study of the Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1363427.Kybalion).

  This book was my first dipping into Hermetic philosophy and mysticism. There
  are lot of things I would like to read about in Western mystical traditions,
  and this book was a good starting point.

- [Origin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32283133-origin) by Dan Brown.

  The only reason I _had_ to read the book was that I have read the other books
  from Robert Langdon series by Dan Brown. I didn't have great expectations that
  this book was going to be great, and thus, I wasn't disappointed to find it
  formulaic and predictable.
  
  On the other hand, I quite liked the real implications of a (near?) future
  where AIs might play a very significant role in everyday life with more and
  more autonomy. This book was stimulating in that aspect.
  
- (The Quest for Cosmic Justice)[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86312.The_Quest_for_Cosmic_Justice] by Thomas Sowell.

  This is the first book I've read from Thomas Sowell, and immediately I got a
  inkling to explore more of his books.
  
- [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck) by Mark Manson.

  This was a fun quick read.

- [Call Me by Your Name](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98687.Call_Me_by_Your_Name) by Andr√©
  Aciman.
  
  This was a truly engrossing read. I read the book before watching the movie,
  and this book got me even more interested to watch it.

- [Prometheus Rising](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28597.Prometheus_Rising) by Robert Anton Wilson.

  This is my first introduction to Robert Anton Wilson and it was a fun read. He
  tries to synthesise a different strands of thoughts into a cohesive framework
  with explanations borrowed from both Western and Eastern traditions.

- [Intellectuals and
  Race](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16280863-intellectuals-and-race) by
  Thomas Sowell.
  
  This is a book talking about a complex topic in an objective manner as much as
  possible without being dogmatic about its own conclusions.
