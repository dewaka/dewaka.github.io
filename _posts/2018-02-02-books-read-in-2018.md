These are the books I have read thus far in 2018.

- [A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3047.A_Conflict_of_Visions) by Thomas Sowell.

  This is a great book to read in times like ours where political climate so
  polarised and driven by partisan frenzy. This books sheds light on different
  modes of thinking between traditional Liberal vs. Conservative political
  ideas.

- [Artemis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34928122-artemis) by Andy Weir.

  I got started reading this book because of the more famous book - The Martian,
  even though I haven't read it yet. Artemis, however, wasn't that interesting
  read even though I kind of liked the plot. I couldn't simply ignore the
  incongruities of the heroine's character.

- [Kybalion: A Study of the Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1363427.Kybalion).

  This book was my first dipping into Hermetic philosophy and mysticism. There
  are lot of things I would like to read about in Western mystical traditions,
  and this book was a good starting point.

- [Origin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32283133-origin) by Dan Brown.

  The only reason I _had_ to read the book was that I have read the other books
  from Robert Langdon series by Dan Brown. I didn't have great expectations that
  this book was going to be great, and thus, I wasn't disappointed to find it
  formulaic and predictable.

  On the other hand, I quite liked the real implications of a (near?) future
  where AIs might play a very significant role in everyday life with more and
  more autonomy. This book was stimulating in that aspect.

- [The Quest for Cosmic Justice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86312.The_Quest_for_Cosmic_Justice) by Thomas Sowell. 

  This was my first introduction to Thomas Sowell's writings, and I immediately
  got interested to read more of his writings. In this book, Sowell tries to
  discuss about a very important subject, cosmic justice, in a dispassionate
  manner. I think that kind of matter of fact analysis is always good to have,
  especially on a subject as contentious as Cosmic justice, or its recent
  formulations in the form of Social justice.

- [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck) by Mark Manson.

  This was a quick fun read.

- [Call Me by Your Name](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98687.Call_Me_by_Your_Name) by Andr√©
  Aciman.

  This was a truly engrossing read. I read the book before watching the movie,
  and this book got me even more interested to watch the film.

- [Prometheus Rising](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28597.Prometheus_Rising) by Robert Anton Wilson.

  This is my first introduction to Robert Anton Wilson and it was a fun read. He
  tries to synthesise a different strands of thoughts into a cohesive framework
  with explanations borrowed from both Western and Eastern traditions from
  Quantum mechanics to Pranayama Yoga. This was a thought provoking read, and
  I'm interested to read more books from him.

- [Intellectuals and
  Race](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16280863-intellectuals-and-race) by
  Thomas Sowell.

  This is a book talking about a complex topic in an objective manner as much as
  possible without being dogmatic about its own conclusions. Similar to The
  Quest for Cosmic Justice by Sowell, this book also discusses how to bring
  change and improvements classes of people who were historically marginalised.
