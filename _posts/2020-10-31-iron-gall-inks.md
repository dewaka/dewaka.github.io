## A bit of history

<!-- Iron Gall inks have a facinating history as they were one of the most commonly used inks to write in historical times. -->

<!-- ## What is gall? -->


<!-- Following definition is from wikipedia[^gall-def], -->

<!-- > Galls are a kind of swelling growth on the external tissues of plants, fungi, or animals[^gall-def] -->

<!-- They are rich in iron. -->

<!-- Breaking down /iron gall/. What is gall? -->

<!-- Current inks you can buy? -->

<!-- The inks I'm tryging -->


> Iron gall ink is a purple-black or brown-black ink made from iron salts and tannic acids from vegetable sources[^wiki-iron-gall]

As a fountain pen enthusiast, it was pretty interesting to learn about the
history and modern incarnations of this particular type of inks.

Both Leonardo's notebooks and Isaac Newton's notebooks seemed to have contain
writing primarily with iron gall inks, such as the following image
from a Leonardo's notebooks[^leonardo]. It is these _"vintage"_ colouring which
initially got me interesting to try iron gall inks as well.

<!-- This is not at all surprising given that these types of inks were the most 
     popular ink type for writing during both of their time periods. -->

<!-- Pure iron gall inks do not work well with fountain pens due to their corrosive -->
<!-- nature, which can damage both the feed and the nib. Hence why modern formulation -->
<!-- of gall inks from manufacturers have different chemicals to limit those damaging -->
<!-- properties. -->

It was also pretty interesting to read[^fountain-pen-forum] about a recipe for iron gall inks in Newton's
notebooks - [Chemistry of Isaac
Newton](http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/mss/dipl/ALCH00110#f2r).
Then again, it is not all that surprising given that in those days iron gall
inks _were_ the common inks people used to write with.

## Modern iron gall ink - Rohrer and Klingner Scabiosa

Due to their corrosive nature, pure iron gall inks cannot be used with fountain
pens[^fp-iron-gall], but there are modern incarnations of these inks which are
milder to both fountain pens and paper. Rohrer and Klingner has two iron gall
inks their fountain pen ink lines as of this writing -
[Scabiosa](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/rohrer-klingner-scabiosa-iron-gall-ink-sample?variant=11884702793771)
and
[Salix](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/rohrer-klingner-salix-iron-gall-ink-sample).
Scabiosa is a dark violet colour and Salix is a blue/black colour.

Since I have plenty of blue and black colours already, I chose Scabiosa to try
as the first iron gall type of ink. This is one of the two iron gall inks from
the Rohrer and Klingner fountain pen inks range. Since I already have (too) many
Blue inks, I thought of trying out the Scabiosa first, which is a dark violet
ink.

## The pen - Twisby Diamond 580

Given that Scabiosa comes with the advisory that the ink shouldn't be left too
long in the fountain pen, I decided to try the ink with my most frequently used
fountain pen in rotation, [TWISBI Diamond 580](https://amzn.to/30pkW9I).

There were couple of other reasons I chose this particular pen to partner with
Scabiosa.

Twisby Diamond 580 has user replaceble nibs. Thus if something goes _wrong_ I
can replace just the nib, which is considerably less expensive than buying a new
pen. In fact, I already have an extra medium nib for this model, which is the
origianl nib I got with the pen.

Other reason is that Twisby pens are very easy to clean and
disassemble[^twisby-disassemble], unlike many piston filler fountain pens from
other brands, even though you do not have to remove more than the nib unit for a
thorough cleaning.
  
## Writing experience

<!-- What is my experience thus far? -->

As for the writing experience, it has been great like all other Rohrer and
Klingner inks I've tried thus far. This ink definitely smells and writes
differntly though, which shows its iron gall heritage in interesting ways.

Scabiosa is on the drier side when it comes to ink flow, but nothing much to
complain about. I didn't experience the feed drying out at all.

Freshly written notes has a noticible smell from other inks from this brand
which I'm familiar with. It is not overpowering or offensive though.

This is an ink which's colouring is quite hard to show in a picture and I'm not
even going to attempt it because there are better sources for that, such as,
- [Pen Addict - Rohrer & Klingner Scabiosa Review](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2013/10/4/rohrer-klingner-scabiosa-review)
- [Rohrer and Klingner Scabiosa: Ink Review](http://blog.gouletpens.com/2012/01/rohrer-and-klingner-scabiosa/)

As noted in these reviews, it has also been my experience that the colouring
changes with time pretty quickly. Fresh ink has more violet tones in my own
writing, then changing to darker brownish colour as the ink gets oxidized. It is
fun just to observe the colour change on freshly written notes, esp. on a fine
line of ink where you get to see the lighter shades easily. I found that the
inks shading is also sensitive to the paper as well.

All in all Scabiosa is quite a fun ink to try for me thus far.

<!-- On this fine nib pen, it is writing quite well. Like all the Rohrer and Klingner -->
<!-- inks I've tried thus far, and I have used about 5 inks thus far, Scabiosa also -->
<!-- has excellent flow properties and quick dry times on the fountain pen and paper -->
<!-- I've tried. -->

<!-- Why am I writing this? -->
