## Notable Books

I had a pretty productive year when it comes to reading. Following are some of
the notable books from the ones I read this year.

### Poetry

- [Mary Oliver](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/23988.Mary_Oliver)'s
  poetry was one of the best discoveries for me this year. I ended up reading
  about five poetry collections from her and I liked all of them. Among the
  collections, [Felicity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611522-felicity),
  [House of Light](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178965.House_of_Light)
  and [Red Bird](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2282485.Red_Bird) contaied
  some of the favourite poems by her.
- [Native Guard](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1857675.Native_Guard) -
  Another stellar poetry collection which left a mark in mind.
- [Delights and
  Shadows](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/239229.Delights_and_Shadows) -
  One of the best books of poetry I've read this year. Definitely need to read a
  couple of times more!
- [The Selected Poems of Donald
  Hall](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23719372-the-selected-poems-of-donald-hall) -
  Some heartwrenching poems on loss. Poems on nature and the craft of poetry
  itself are not shabby either.

### Science and Science fiction

- [Brief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen
  Hawking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40277241-brief-answers-to-the-big-questions) -
  This is a compilation of essays after his passing. Hawking has a knack for
  explaining difficult concepts lucidly and this compilation is no exception.
- [Brave New World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World) -
  A long awaited read for me. Thought provoking book on future and life itself.
- [The Woman in the
  Dunes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9998.The_Woman_in_the_Dunes) - A
  deceptively simple tale of a man being kept captive is one of the best
  existential novels I've read thus far.
- [The Invention of
  Morel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94486.The_Invention_of_Morel) -
  This short novella provides a lot of food for thought on reality.

### Novels

- [Snow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11691.Snow) - A powerful story
  about love, religion, freedom and poetic expression. Looking forward to read
  other novels by him!
- [The Virgin
  Suicides](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10956.The_Virgin_Suicides) - I
  have not seen the film, but it has been on my _to watch_ list for a while. So,
  I was extra keen to read the book first and I hooked to the story pretty
  quickly. I felt like at times I was one of _them_ wanting to know about the
  girls in the story, and perhaps _rescue_ them.
- [Ham on Rye](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38501.Ham_on_Rye) - Although
  I'm not the biggest fan of Bukowski's writing style, or for that matter his
  subject matter, I quite liked Ham on Rye novel. He does have a knack of
  delivering truths about human nature which shines through at times and nobody
  can accuse of him not being genuine which is an admirable quality!
- [Laughable Loves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26101.Laughable_Loves) -
  This is the first book I read by Milan Kundera and I enjoyed the short stories
  very much. Looking forward to read his more celebrated works such as The
  Unbearable Lightness of Being.
- [Rashōmon and Seventeen Other Stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35206.Rash_mon_and_Seventeen_Other_Stories) -
  I was surprised how short the Rashōmon story was having seen the film a while
  ago. There are many other equally intersting and throught provoking stories by
  Akutagawa in this collection.

### Philosophy

- [The Bhagavad
  Gita](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99942.The_Bhagavad_Gita) - I really
  liked the accessible translation by Eknath Easwaran. One does not have to have
  a background in Hindu philosophy to read and get the most out of this
  translation, although in my case I was familiar with most of the Hindu
  concepts due to closely shared background from Buddhism.
- [How to Be Free: An Ancient Guide to the Stoic
  Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39204065-how-to-be-free) - This is a
  new translation of Epictetus's handbook on Stoicism.
  
## Blog posts

- [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must
  Know About Unicode and Character
  Sets](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/) -
  this a post I will keep coming back to.

## Music

Following are some frequent listens this year which broke trends from past years
but not necessarily new music for me,

- [Tom Waits](https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits)
- [Brandi Carlile](https://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile)
- [Kate Bush](https://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush) - I think it is only this
  year that I've come to really appreciate her music. Big big fan of Hounds of
  Love album.
- [Joni Mitchell](https://www.last.fm/music/Joni+Mitchell)
- [Gabriel Fauré](https://www.last.fm/music/Gabriel+Faur%C3%A9) - Cello Works<sup>[1](#faure-cello-spotify)</sup> 
  are my favourites thus far.
- [Norman Fucking
  Rockwell!](https://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/Norman+Fucking+Rockwell!) -
  Quickly becoming my favourite Lana Del Rey album thus far!
- [Melody Gardot](https://www.last.fm/music/Melody+Gardot) - Another perfect
  choice if I'm in the mood for Jazz!
- [Anoushka Shankar](https://www.last.fm/music/Anoushka+Shankar) - I discovered
  her through Norah Jones colloborations.
- [Frank Ocean](https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean) - Blonde was one of the
  top listens for me this year. I'm 3 years late to the party!


## Videos

- [The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/) - It was
  quite easy to like this series from Amazon for me.
- [The Big Bang Theory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/) - This was a
  nostalgic rewatch for me, except from 9th season onward. It was nice to see
  the episodes with Stephen Hawking and the fun side of him.
- [GM Hikaru](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweCc7bSMX5J4jEH7HFImng) - I
  think I spent more time watching Chess videos on Youtube than TV series or
  films combined! GM Hikaru's streams are quite entertaining as well. And
  there's always something an amateur player like me can learn from his play as
  well, although I do not think watching a super-GM play rapid games is the best
  way to improve at amatuer level.
- [GM Matthew
  Sadler](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0pQR9jhWhWRhAA9v49kurw) - Another
  superb Chess channel in YouTube. I especially enjoyed his expositions on
  Stockfish vs AlphaZero play. It was amazing to see AlphaZero outwit a finely
  tuned Chess engine like Stockfish sometimes in a very dominating fashion like
  a boa constrictor. If Stockfish had feelings, it must have felt like human
  players playing against itself!

## Programming

Although none of the following languages are _new_ to me, I enjoyed using them
in various contexts,

- Prolog - Playing with Logic programming after a long time was quite fun.
- Rust - Rust ticks a couple of boxes for me to keep intersted to explore
  further in coming year.
  - Safe systems programming where it has a real chance to be an alternative to
    domains currently dominated by C/C++.
  - Fearless concurrency<sup>[2](#rust-concurrency)</sup>.
  - cargo is a breath of fresh air compared to C++ build systems I've used in
    the past. I only _wish_ Haskell had such a stellar build tool (although
    stack is pretty good)!
- Clojure - Got a chance to play with Clojure Spec<sup>[3](#clojure-spec)</sup>
  which is an EDSL to express constraints which are difficult to expressed in
  types themselves.
