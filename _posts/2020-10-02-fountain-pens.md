I have always been a fan of fountain pens from my school days and throughout
the university years. But recently I haven't been writing all that much and
consequently my fountain pen usage went down.

However, discovering some really nice fountain pen [inks](#inks) recently rekindled my
interest in fountain pen writing along with taking written notes.

<!-- In typical fashion I have thought about the pros and cons of using fountain pens -->
<!-- for writing and following are my personal reasoning on that. -->

<!-- ## Why not fountain pens? -->

<!-- - I have to be extra careful when using fountain pens, especially with more -->
<!--   expensive fountain pens with gold nibs, I'm always extra careful and actually -->
<!--   have to think about the fact that I'm using a fountain pen which might be more -->
<!--   brittle than a gel or rollerblade pen. I really do not want to drop a fountain -->
<!--   pen if I can help it and most probably either crack a barell or damage its -->
<!--   nib! And this is rarely a concern when I'm scribbling something with any other -->
<!--   type of pen. -->
<!-- - Cleaning them when chaning inks is no fun. Some inks are easier to clean than -->
<!--   others, but invariably I want to rotate inks -->
<!-- - They take a little bit more time to get started from cold. Unscrewing the cap -->
<!--   to first writing. Then you can experience hard starts as well, if you haven't -->
<!--   used the pen for a while. This is rarely the case with a good gel ink pen. -->
  
<!-- Some of the drawbacks can be addressed by fountain pens such as Pilot vanishing -->
<!-- point. -->

<!-- ## Why fountain pens? -->

<!-- - They are cheaper in the long run. -->
<!-- - You get to experiment with lots of colours and inks -->
<!-- - Helps improve handwriting - probably not mine though, at least not the way I -->
<!--   jot down quickly! -->
<!-- - Has more character - this is something hard to describe, but fountain pen -->
<!--   writing is rarely uniform from stroke to stroke as it would be with a -->
<!--   rollerblade pen, for example. These small variences add a character to -->
<!--   fountain pen writing which is hard to replicate with conventional pens. -->

<!-- - This is a personal observation, but I'm generally much faster to write with a -->
<!--   fountain pen than with a ballpoint pen. This is probably due to the flexible -->
<!--   grip I can have with fountain pens. Any decent fountain pen would be far more -->
<!--   forgiving on the way you grip it for writing with a bigger sweet spot than -->
<!--   roller blade pens. This also inclues how strongly or lightly you would want to -->
<!--   apply the pen tip to the paper. I've found fountain pens offer far more -->
<!--   flexiblity in this regard improving my overall scribling speed. -->
  
<!--   I have read rave reviews of [Uni-Ball AIR 0.7mm Medium -->
<!--   Rollerball](https://amzn.to/3n4Jo9X) which supposedly gets close to fountain -->
<!--   pen writing experience, but I haven't had a chance to use them, yet. -->

Since I liked these inks so much and given that I learnt about them only
recently, I thought of writing a short blog post on how they look on paper and
other fountain pen related things I tend to use or have used in the past.

## Paper

Fountain pens demands a certain qualities from paper to have a good writing
experience. When it comes to paper, getting high quality gsm paper is probably a
safe start even if we ignore many other factors which influence the writing
quality with fountain pens. Following are some of the popular notebooks among
fountain pen users which I have also used in the past,
- [LEUCHTTURM1917 Dotted Notebooks](https://amzn.to/340mA2F) - these notebooks
  are excellent for fountain pen writing as they do not bleed through even when
  writing with the wettest fountain pens and ink combinations. These notebooks
  comes with dotted paper as well, which are quite nice for writing with
  fountain pens since it give more flexiliby to control your letter sizes to fit
  your fancy and style.
- [Moleskine Classic Ruled Paper Notebook](https://amzn.to/36c6zJu) - At least
  from my experience they were not as good as the Leuchtturm notebooks when it
  comes to properties such as bleedthrough.

Following are my current favourite notebooks for bulk writing,
- [Oxford My Notes, A5 Notebook](https://amzn.to/33qyuU8) - These books I found
  to be as good as more expensive Leuchtturm1917 even for fountain pen usage.
- [Cambridge Jotter, A5 notebooks](https://amzn.to/33qlu0Z) - These ones are
  even cheaper than Oxford ones, but they are a little lighter and wouldn't be
  of the highest standard when it comes to fountain writing.

Latter is even cheaper and great for writing stuff you wouldn't want to keep for
long. This is pretty useful for my language practice where I tend to write like
a nursery kid for learning new languages.


## Pens

<!-- I do not collect fountain pens as a hobby, but I do have a collection of about -->
<!-- six fairly decent medium range fountain pens which I use on a regular basis. As -->
<!-- daily writers I tend to use following pens and I often have at least three of -->
<!-- fountain pens inked up in different colours. -->

Although I do not collect fountain pens as a hobby, I have bought more than a
few fountain pens over the years. I try not to buy fountain pens which I would
think twise to ink up and use on a daily basis. This heuristic has helped me
curb my enthusiasm for spending a lots of money on really expensive pens!

Following are some of my favourite fountain pens[^affiliate-links] which are
almost always inked up, if I happen to be in fountain pen mood,

- [TWSBI Diamond 580](https://amzn.to/30pkW9I) - TWISBI makes relatively
  affordable steel nib fountain pens which are excellent for writing
- [Lami Safari](https://amzn.to/338H7D0) - These pens comes in myriad colours
  and would be a perfect pen to get as a starter pen. Make sure to get a
  converter as well since they only come with a Lamy cartridge.
- [Platinum 3776 (Chartres Blue)](https://amzn.to/36sjhns) - This is on the
  smaller side for my hands, but it is comfortable after posting. This is an
  excellent writer and I really like the Japanese fine nib for writing given my
  preference for fine nibs. In fact, Platinum F nib is even finer than the Lamy
  Safari EF nib!

My nib preference is usually on the finer side due to a couple of factors such
as my handwriting size and the purpose (which is mostly note taking).

## Inks

In the past I have been quite conservative in my ink choices, sticking with
excellent Waterman fountain pen inks and occasionally Diamine inks. For people
getting started with fountain pens, sticking with inks which are known to work
with most type of nibs and papers is a good way to go. Most Waterman inks
definitely ticks those boxes in my experience as well.

<!-- The inks which rekindled my interest for fountain pens are Rohrer and Kingner -->
<!-- inks. Until this year I have been sticking to conservative ink choices which are -->
<!-- both widely avialble, inexpensive and known to work on a wide range of pens. -->

<!-- ## Writing samples -->

After coming across [Rohrer and Klingner Cassia Ink Review](https://gentlemanreviewer.com/2020/02/rohrer-and-klingner-cassia/), I
also got interested to try [Rohrer and Klingner](https://www.rohrer-klingner.de/?page_id=1014&lang=en) 
inks and following are the ones which I tried recently. All the inks below have really
good flow and quick drying properties. As far as I can see, they are pretty easy
to clean as well.

Note that my writing samples are only good as a crude approximation for what the
inks look on Oxford notebook paper.

### Cassia

![cassia]({{ "/assets/postassets/fountain-pens/cassia.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-center }

Cassia is my favourite out of the three Rohrer and Klingner inks I've gotten
thus far. It is a very lively purple with really good ink flow properties. My
writing sample, which is from a Lamy Safari with a fine nib on Oxford notebook
papper, cannot do justice to how nice this ink looks in person at all. See
Goulet pen's for a better review - [Goulet pen's Rohrer and Klingner Cassia
Review](https://blog.gouletpens.com/2012/01/rohrer-and-klingner-cassia-review/).

### Blau Permanent

![blau]({{ "/assets/postassets/fountain-pens/blau.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-center }

Blue is a staple colour for me and I have been very happy with Waterman blue
inks, of which I have at least two shades. But, I found that I quite like the
Blau Permanent ink from Rohrer as well and this sample is from the Platinum 3776
with a fine nib on Oxford notebook paper.

For a better a review check this out [Goulet pen's Rohrer and Klingner Blau Permanent Review](https://blog.gouletpens.com/2012/01/rohrer-and-klingner-blau-permanen/).

### Bordeaux

![bordeaux]({{ "/assets/postassets/fountain-pens/bordeaux.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-center }

This is my first reddish colour fountain pen ink and altough not my favourite to
write notes with, it does add a nice variety when I feel like. Rohrer and
Klingner Bordeaux is, as the name suggests a very nice Wine coloured ink. This
sample is from a Lamy Safari extra fine pen on the same paper as before. See
[Goulet pen's Rohrer and Klingner Alt-Bordeaux
Review](https://blog.gouletpens.com/2012/01/rohrer-and-klingner-alt-bordeaux-review/).

I hope to explore more of the Rohrer and Klingner ink range in the future.
