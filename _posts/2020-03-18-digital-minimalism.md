Minimising digital footprint and reducing distractions has been a topic I am
interested in for a while now. In that backdrop, I recently came across a book
which resonated with me, 
[Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/), 
from [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com).

## What is digital minimalism?

Cal Newport defines digital minimalism as follows[^dm-definition],

> A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small
> number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support
> things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.

## Why aim for digital minimalism?

Maintaining an always on online presence can be huge energy drain, not
necessarily physically, but mentally. From personal experience, even passively
consuming reddit and Hacker News[^hacker-news] is definitely a big time drain,
which I try to be more concious about these days.

## Personal strategies

### Being topical

Reddit and hacker news have been few of the main sources for technical news for
me. But these days I try to limit the time spent on those web sites by following
some of the strategies outlined below.

Being topical - limit browsing to a select number of to topics I'm interested
in at a particular time. These days it is mostly subreddits on
[Rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/),
[Linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/),
[Haskell](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/) and a few other niche topics like
Emacs. I actively try to limit to subreddits with high signal-to-noise ratio,
and this rules out most of the sporting subreddits, some of which I used to
follow closely!

### Reading books

Allocating more of the leisure time to reading books. These days I like to have
a couple of books reading at the same time on different topics so that there is
more choice to switch within books instead of going back to something like
reddit for amusement.

Unlike with link aggregation services, it is easier to stay focused on a book
even on an electronic device like Kindle _because_ you are essentially limited.

### Limiting _tools_

There were many services and tools which I used to use in the past but which I
have given up in the name of simplicity. This varied from note taking apps such
as Evernote to goal tracking tools such as Trello[^trello] and
Beeminder[^beeminder]. All of them are very useful tools, but I have found
simpler alternatives which I do not have to stay connected to use as their
replacment[^org-mode].

Problem with using too many tools is that you spend too much time on
housekeeping these tools than actually getting things done! At least this has
been my personal experience.

I'm sure with better integration into one's lifestyle habits most of these tools
could be a net positive.

### Limiting social media

Since I have never been much of a social media user, not regularly using popular
social sites has not been a problem for me. Even though I still keep a facebook
account, these days it is mostly as the last point of concact than actually to
keep up to date with relatives, friends and acquaintenances.

### Less distrating phone usage

I find phone to be quite distracting as well and thus try to minimise its usage
as much as possible as well. For example, at work times I tend to keep the phone
in the backpack at most times to not even have it at arms length to check for
notifications. This is a consicous choice to have the possibility of even
missing a call once in a while!

Also using a flip phone cover makes it a bit more difficult to see notifictions
since I have to open the cover to see the screen.

## Downsides of _my_ choices

Not keeping up to date on social networks definitely have downsides. Sometimes I
find that I'm years behind when it comes to updates from people. All of a sudden
you find that one of your best friends (who's in a different country) even has a
kid now! This can be a serendipitous discovery. Also when you meet them in
person you can be actually interested in them in real life because most of the
things are new to you since you last met them. I'm pretty sure there's a better
middle ground than the position I tend to exercise. For example, having a
dedicated time period to check those platforms once in a while, would be better
than complete cut off in many ways.

As Cal Newport talks about in the book, individual solutions are going to be
invariably personal. What works for me is not necessarily going to work for you,
and as outlined above, some of my practical strategies might sound silly and
dracononian to you.

The point is that digital tools are just tools - some _means_ to an end. The
means of achieving control is not that important as much as the end goal (which
could be anything!). Thus it really does not matter all that much how you use
them as long as you manage to find the balance between productivity and value
_from_ the tools which works for _you_. It helps to be flexible, adaptive and
also _honest_ when it comes to technology.

I think, the book, _Digital Minimalism_, manages to get that idea across pretty
well. The book talks about finding a balance without preaching the author's
point of view. The solutions offerred are _not_ groundbreaking, but at the same
time I think it is a worthy topic to explore further; thus a recommended read.
